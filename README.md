<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

Discrete Mathematics (CSC303) is a fundamental subject in the Second Year (Semester III) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. This course provides the mathematical foundations necessary for computer science, focusing on discrete structures rather than continuous ones.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key mathematical domains:

- **Logic and Proofs**: Propositional logic, predicates, quantifiers, and mathematical induction.
- **Set Theory and Relations**: Set operations, properties of relations, equivalence relations, and partial orderings.
- **Combinatorics**: Counting techniques, permutations, combinations, and generating functions.
- **Graph Theory**: Graph terminology, Euler and Hamilton paths, trees, and graph coloring.
- **Algebraic Structures**: Groups, rings, fields, and Boolean algebra.
- **Recurrence Relations**: Solving linear recurrence relations and application in algorithm analysis.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, question papers, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that discrete mathematical foundations remain essential for solving complex engineering problems and understanding theoretical computer science. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental mathematical concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Discrete Mathematics.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
